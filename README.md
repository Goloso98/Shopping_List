# Shopping list website
Done in flask and sqlite

Run with `flask run`

Prone to XSS, but sql injection is *safe*.

Need some styling, with bootstrap maybe.
Will dockerize.
Use env.

Maybe use a *proper* database (aka mariadb/mysql)

## not inteded with this project
(at least for now)
 - multi user
 - multiple lists
